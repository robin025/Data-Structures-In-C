# RECURSION

Recursion is a process of function callling itself,it is a laternate approch to interation.

Comparatively **RECURSION** takes more time and space.

 - The problem must satisfy the following conditions.So has to use recursion.
    - The problem must be recursive in nature that is problem can be expressed in terms of itself.
    - There must be a terminating condition.
    - Terminating condition must be reached in finite steps.
    

- TOWER ON HANOI
  - The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle 
  - In this we have three rods and n discs of varying diametre.
  - The problem is to shift the n discs from source rod to destination rod with the help of an another rod(A to C with the help of B).
  - **Rules**
      - Only one disc must be move at a time.
      - Longer diameter disc cannot be kept on a smaller diameter disc.
