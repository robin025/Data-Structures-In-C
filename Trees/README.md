# TREES

It is a collection of nodes connected in non linear manner with a designnated node called route from which the tree originates.

- ## Main applications of trees include:
   - Manipulate hierarchical data.
   - Make information easy to search ( tree traversal).
   - Manipulate sorted lists of data.
   - Router algorithms
   - Form of a multi-stage decision-making (see business chess).

- **Binary Search Tree** is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties
    
    - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
    - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
    - The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
